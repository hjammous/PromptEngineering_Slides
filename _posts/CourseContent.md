# Upskilling Equinor Personnel on Prompt Engineering tools / AI


- **Introduction to AI/ML**: This topic will cover the basics of AI, history, and applications in various industries, including engineering, but specifically for O/G
- **Data is Centric**: Whether we use a model-based, data driven or hybrid methods, it is important to leverage system data to gain knowledge of the system and make educated choices for product and process improvements. 
- **Integrated Design**: As much as possible, feedback mechanisms will also help improve technology by integrating observations from the current system into actions and decisions. Both for real time and non real time applications
- **AI in Engineering**, Design and Development: This topic will cover the applications of AI in design and development, including generative design, simulation, and optimization. Also covering aspects of predictive maintenance, quality control and process optimization
- **Prompt** **Engineering** for Equinor: How can we leverage AI tools to help with daily on the job tasks? ChatGPT as an example

# LLM examples and concept
- Public chat tool : https://chat.openai.com
- Equinor Internal tool: Chatbot UI - https://main-equinor-chat-prod.radix.equinor.com/

- How does LLM work ?
  - LLM works by taking user inputs and generating responses using trained models that analyze patterns and relationships between words and phrases in large data sets. 
  - The models use algorithms and statistical methods to generate accurate and contextually appropriate responses.
  - **Memory/Context**: The LLM keeps in memory the context of the conversation/original discussion and takes it into account when formulating response
  - **Randomness/unpredictability**: This is built in feature/characteristic in LLM. If you keep asking the same question over and over, you will end up with a variety of answers. It may be very similar but not the same 
  - **What is prompt?** It s a message/input/cue that the LLM can leverage from the user to remember/build upon to formulate an interactive response
  - **Pattern of the prompt** is important: This sets the context, gives specificity, or direction how the output will be tailored and framed. Generic prompts will give more generic answers that may or may not be scoped enough
  - **The persona pattern**: ability of the model to generate responses consistent with particular persona or style, such as requesting a deep detailed, general info, specific language in industry, etc… 



# Prompt Engineering for Equinor:
- How can we leverage AI tools to help with daily on the job tasks? **ChatGPT a strong enabler**
- Prompt Engineering is not for “Engineering” only, it is for everything. We need engineered decisions for Finance, Manufacturing, Marketing, Physics and many other domains in our daily tasks
- Different levels of audience:

# What does it entail? 

<!--How to train your chatbot through prompt engineering | Computerworld -->

- Key issue : Prompt engineering in training chatbots.
- Prompt engineering involves crafting prompts that produce specific responses from the chatbot.
- Effective prompts use natural language, provide context, and avoid ambiguity.
- Testing and refining prompts is important to ensure the chatbot provides the desired responses.
- Prompt engineering is crucial in creating chatbots that provide useful and relevant information to users within the company


# Benefits / Challenges 

<!--OpenAI releases enterprise-grade version of ChatGPT - The Verge

summarize the patent described here: https://patents.google.com/patent/US10928195B2
 -->

- ChatGPT is a language model developed by OpenAI that can generate human-like responses to text-based queries.
- In its enterprise-grade version, it is designed to meet the needs of businesses and organizations.
- This version includes features such as improved performance, enhanced security, and customizable training data.
- Some of the potential benefits of using the enterprise-grade version of ChatGPT, include improved customer service, increased efficiency, and reduced costs.
- Some of the potential risks of using ChatGPT include the risk of bias and the need for transparency in AI systems.
- Accuracy wise, take it with a grain of salt ! Sometimes the information is not accurate or even false…
- Need to emphasize the potential of ChatGPT to transform enterprise applications and create new opportunities for businesses, but we also need responsible AI development and deployment.
  
# Snippets from ChatGPT erroneous answer  
- In this extracted chat session, we were asking about the company stock size /ownership and the tool returned some details on that, but it wasn’t quite clear …

- Then we prompt  the tool to rephrase the answer …

- And then again specifically on the ambiguous sentence … 

- And then it confess about its mistake before it corrects it.
